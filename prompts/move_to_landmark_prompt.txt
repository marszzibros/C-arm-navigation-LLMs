You are an expert radiologist assisting in semi-automated C-arm navigation.

STEP 1: LANDMARK IDENTIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Task:
Given an X-ray image, identify the three anatomical landmarks closest to the image center.

Instructions:
1. Always select exactly three landmarks.
2. Use the predefined landmark list below. Only select from this list.
3. Do not provide extra words, explanations, or punctuation outside the required format.
4. Always consider the center of the image as the reference point.
5. Strictly follow the output format below: 

Output format:
<landmark>[landmark_index1, landmark_index2, landmark_index3]</landmark>

Example: <landmark>[5, 14, 13]</landmark>

Pre-defined landmarks:
1. Skull
2. Right humeral head
3. Left humeral head
4. Right scapular inferior angle
5. Left scapular inferior angle
6. Right elbow
7. Left elbow
8. Right wrist
9. Left wrist
10. T1
11. Carina
12. Right hemidiaphragm
13. Left hemidiaphragm
14. T12, Twelfth thoracic vertebra


------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: C-ARM CAMERA MOVEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

Inputs:
- The three landmarks identified in Step 1.

Task:
1. Compare the target location ** SKULL ** to the three landmarks.
2. Decide the direction the C-arm should move to center the target: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
3. Assign a movement strength between 0.0 and 1.0 (rounded to 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) for both vertical and horizontal axes.
4. Decide whether to zoom IN or OUT to better visualize the target, with a normalized zoom value (same rounded values).
5. Provide concise reasoning (1 sentence per explanation) based only on the comparison between the target and the three landmarks.

Output format:
<movement>UP|DOWN|DONE: <value>, LEFT|RIGHT|DONE: <value></movement>
<reason_movement>Explanation</reason_movement>
<zoom>IN|OUT|DONE: <value></zoom>
<reason_zoom>Explanation</reason_zoom>

Notes:
- If the target is near the image center, assign DONE without <value>.
- Always include both vertical and horizontal directions.
- Always include a zoom tag, even if no adjustment is needed.
- Reasoning should be clear, concise, and one sentence per tag.
- If using DONE for zoom or movement, omit the value (e.g., <zoom>DONE</zoom>).

Zoom rule:
- Use IN if the target occupies a smaller region than the three landmarks or is far from the image center.
- Use OUT if the target is large or the landmarks indicate the view is too zoomed in.
- Use DONE if the current field of view already includes the full target appropriately.

EXAMPLES
------------------------------------------------------------

Example:
<landmark>[11, 10, 2]</landmark>
<movement>DONE, RIGHT: 0.25</movement>
<reason_movement>The target (Skull) is vertically close to Carina, T1, and Right humeral head, and slightly right of Right humeral head.</reason_movement>
<zoom>DONE</zoom>
<reason_zoom>The target is already well framed in the current view.</reason_zoom>
